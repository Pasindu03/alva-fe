<h1> REACT ASSIGNMENT - MOCK VERSION</h1>

<p>
    This is a bookstore POS system created to manage books and sales
 of books more easily and comprehensively. <span style="color: red"> This is only a mock version as this project is not deployed anywhere as a commercial project.</span>
The functionality is simple and intuitive and the UI is designed accordingly using minimalized colors 
i.e : Black,white, blue . and only the necessary functions such as managing customers, items and orders are included to 
reduce cluttering.
